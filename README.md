Our project MAPPAS TRAVEL BUDDY is a *Travel Companion Platform* designed to empower users to explore the world independently while offering a seamless and personalized experience. The platform features a *Search and Explore* functionality that provides a detailed guide for any chosen destination, including must-visit attractions, activities, and budget-friendly accommodation options.  

We also offer *Budget Travel* tools, allowing users to find nearby hotels and restaurants categorized by cost, making it easy to plan meals and stays within their budget.  

For entertainment, the platform includes a *Mood-Based Music Playlist* feature that connects with Spotify to provide curated travel-friendly playlists.  

To ensure safety, we‚Äôve integrated an *Emergency Button* that provides quick access to nearby police stations and emergency contacts, acting as an SOS for solo travelers or those in dangerous situations.  

With these features, our platform ensures users can enjoy hassle-free, enjoyable, and secure travel¬†experiences.
